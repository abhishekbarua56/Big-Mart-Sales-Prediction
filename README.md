Linear Regression - Time Series Analysis

The BigMart Sales Prediction project aims to forecast sales for various products across multiple BigMart outlets using historical sales data. By developing a machine learning regression model, the project seeks to provide accurate sales predictions for the upcoming year, enabling BigMart to optimize inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies.

The dataset includes sales data for 1,559 products across 10 outlets, with attributes influencing sales. The workflow involved data collection, preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding), and model selection. Various models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were trained, with Linear Regression selected as the final model for its effectiveness in feature selection and predictive accuracy.

The final model was deployed using APIs for real-time predictions, and insights were provided to help BigMart enhance its business operations, such as optimizing product placement and inventory management.
